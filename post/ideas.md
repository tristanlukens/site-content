I have a couple of ideas for articles.

- HTML crash course
- CSS crash course (also covering SASS)
- Markdown
- Git and GitHub
- TailwindCSS
- vim
  I hope I will cover all of these soon.

Also, in my current about page, I talk various subjects. I'm probably going to talk about those as well.

## UPDATE @ MARCH 11th

Well, when I redid my website with graphcms, I decided against using the old about page, but fetching [my then-new github personal readme](https://github.com/tristanlukens/tristanlukens/blob/main/README.md). I like this change, but it's different from the subjects I talked about in my old about page.

_I prefer to call the language go. It's called go. Not golang_

**DISCLAIMER: I'm a TS dev. Keep that in mind when reading this post.**

**Like my [about page](/about) says, I've dabbled in [go](https://go.dev) but mainly worked with TypeScript. I recently picked up go again to do some programming challenges, after I finished a tutorial series and kind of know my way around the language.**

Don't get me wrong, I still like TypeScript, but go is absolutely amazing.

## What problems can be solved with go

Well.

Programming problems, as weird and vague as it may sound. It's quite easy: go is called modern, 21-century C and was designed at Google around 2010 because everyone hated C++.

You can do basically anything in go (as long as it's not writing HTML or CSS or doing anything with websites).

You can do [graphics programming with OpenGL](https://kylewbanks.com/blog/tutorial-opengl-with-golang-part-1-hello-opengl), [mobile app dev (apparently)](https://reemishirsath.medium.com/golang-for-mobile-development-c7391e690f71), but the language is mainly made for the server-side of web development.

## What I've been using it for

Solving small problems to _sharpen my problem-solving skills_ or whatever you want me to say to make me sound interesting.

I've been screwing around, and actually planning to write [markdown-thing](https://github.com/tristanlukens/markdown-thing) in go instead of TS. I might throw plans out the window though, but I'd like to devote a full post to that in the near future. I'll explain everything there. Stay tuned :)

## Why I think go is amazing

### It's wayy safer than TS

Even though TS is way safer than JS, go is like an unlawfully overprotective parent (try to comprehend how bad rust is with safety!!). I like that though.

### It's way less quirky than TS/JS

JavaScript is weird. TypeScript may patch some of it up, but I see JavaScript as broken-beyond-repair.

### The built-in tools

[GitHub-based mirror](https://github.com/golang/tools). Go's tools are really good.

### Modules and packages

I don't have to explain anything. They're absolutely amazing

### The standard library

Go's standard library consist of some really good packages. And it's documentation is really good.

In summary: my experience with go is really good, and I haven't even barely scratched the surface.

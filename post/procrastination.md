So for school today, we needed to pick out a TED Talk and write a couple of comments about it.

I decided to watch [Tim Urban's talk about procrastination](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=arj7oStGLkU). **_This talk is absolutely fantastic._**

## The irony in this post

So in my comments I wrote about this blog and I how I've been procrastinating on writing new posts for a while now. Now, I'm writing a blog post about procrastinating and mentioning that I've been procrastinating on writing blog posts.

That's all I have to say for now. I just hope that I'll write more posts this weekend.

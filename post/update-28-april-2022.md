**Another short update.**

## Go

I like Go. I don't love it. I like it. I'll keep using it until I get really annoyed with the missing features.

## Other languages

I've focused on things like Go for a good while. I'll work frontendmentor thing or something using Svelte and Tailwind. Maybe squash some bugs on this website or make some new features.

## `markdown-thing`

I tried to make a start on the spec. It's hard writing a spec for something you have no idea about! I'll just do it with TS so I can use it with Right without having to rewrite it.

## Some other things on my mind

- As someone who loves math and 3b1b's videos, [Manim](https://github.com/manimcommunity/manim) is really cool
- You should give [Wheel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIzIcRCwJlp5rd5mYsNdEtw) a listen. Their _Moving Backwards_ album is fucking amazing

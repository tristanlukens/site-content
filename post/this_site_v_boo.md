**This site has gone through a lot of iterations, but I think I'll keep it like this for a while.**

Now I just host my blog posts on GitHub and have drum covers here as well.

I could go through what's changed, but well... I won't.

Also, some ol' blog posts cover the previous iterations, and I would go over them all and update them to say that they're talking about an old version, but I'm too lazy to do that.

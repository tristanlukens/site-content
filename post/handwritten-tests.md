I'm writing a document for school right now. And to shamelessly plug the website, I wrote this post.

The document is really practicing writing documents about some advantages and disadvantages to something, and I have chosen handwritten tests as a subject.

In your document, you've got to cite some source and refer to a one, both at least once.

So hereby, I'm going to say the average student doesn't like handwriting documents. Which is true, by the way. We absolutely loathe writing, most of us would much rather type it out.

**So two weeks ago, I installed Windows on me ol' Mac mini. I wanted to try Trackmania Nations Forever. It's free, why not.**

Well.

## The installations

It was a nightmare getting Windows to be installed correctly.

### Getting installation media

Getting a USB to install was a nightmare. I couldn't get it to work on my MacBook Air, so I had to go to Linux to create installation media. That'd be fine, if that'd worked. It didn't! Don't remember why. My way of getting Windows installation media was to, hold your horses, install Ubuntu first, and from there create Windows installation media.

So that's the first stage passed.

### Installation

Getting the installation to start was a nightmare as well.

I also want to say I was a fair few hours into the project by this time.

First having to go through Microsoft's Windows setup screen was horrible.

> No?
> What?!
> Pleaseeee!

Anyway, after a good hour or something I got to the installation window.

### Setup

After being absolutely done with the begging for logging in, I finally used my Microsoft account (yes, I have one of those. Solely for being able to play Minecraft, not because I use it or anything) to log in.

After another few hours I had everything set up to play Minecraft and to play Trackmania. It took way to much time. And you know what? It wasn't worth it at all. Minecraft ran just as shit as always, and Trackmania had fucked up low-res textures that I couldn't fix.

**Oh, and I didn't have sound.**

## Forager

So I discovered Forager on YouTube a couple of days ago, with [a three-year-old lets play by wattles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmWk5dgGeYM&list=PL0oJ2_Q2jPrcm9-kKKnATo4Ja6aovptLU&index=5) (one of my favourite YouTubers). Shortly after, I discovered that there was a free demo on itch.io.

> Well, it's free and I have Windows on my Mac mini, so why not try it?

After studying for a math test I'd take the day after, I switched my amplifier to the Mac mini's HDMI and turned it on.

## Blue screen

```
:(

We're collecting some error info.

0%
```

Well, blue screen. It stayed on 0% for ten minutes, after which I decided I wanted to yeet Windows and put Linux back on the machine, so I figured I wasn't going to wait for the percentage to go up, so I hard-rebooted (using the power button), and it was restarting fine.

Until the screen froze, and I had to hard-reboot AGAIN.

(god Windows was a nightmare!)

Finally, at long last, I was back in Windows 10.

I tried Forager, really liked it, but had to start studying for a physics test I'd have to take the day after (yes, physics AND math. Math would take 150 minutes, physics 100).

## Yeeting Windows

I'm very proud to announce that, though it didn't go very smoothly, I yeeted Windows and put Fedora Linux on the thing.

It works incredibly well!

## Forager, again

I actually came across [an article](https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2020/09/the-itchio-app-can-now-use-a-system-installed-wine-on-linux-for-windows-only-games/) that said the itch.io app would automatically scan for Wine installations. When I was done installing Fedora, I installed the itch.io app, ran `sudo dnf install wine`, waited for a while (everything worked!), installed Forager, and above all odds, it fucking worked!

I didn't have to do any additional setup.

And Fedora is amazing.

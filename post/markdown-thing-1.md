_This is the first part of a series of blog posts on `markdown-thing`._

I mentioned in the previous post that I'd write an article about markdown-thing, so here it is, though it will be a short one this time.

## What is `markdown-thing`?

A markdown processor.

I work with markdown a lot and since Typora is paid now, I want to create my own markdown writer called Right (a play on the word write amiwrite?). I'm going to create the processor first. I don't know how exactly, but I did know that I was going to use test-driven TypeScript.

Now I've been using Go a lot, I've changed my plans a little bit.

The plan now, is to do a little research on compilers and write a spec for markdown-thing. I'll then write the main implementation of said spec in Go. I'll still need to write an implementation in TS ‚Äî I want to make right with web technologies and have it browser-based. I can't use Go in the frontend part of the browser.

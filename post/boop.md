There's quite a handy app for macOS that's called Boop â€” a minimal app that uses a command palette to alter text via scripts. No other features (which is a good thing).

---

It's available in the Mac App Store, or via `brew`. You bet I use `brew`.

`brew install --cask boop`

---

All it does is transform text. It's got some good default transformation scripts built-in, but you can also write your own. There's also some more in the github repo.

[Because yeah, had I mentioned that it's open source?](https://github.com/IvanMathy/Boop)

---

They're not paying me to say this by the way, I just really like the project.

Anyway's, happy typing.

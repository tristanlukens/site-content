Here's my drum cover of Hysteria.

---

It's not the most technical song in the world, but it requires some level of limb independence, especially in the verses. There's a open-and-closing hihat ostinato going on, but also a kick pattern. I'm very thankful that I pushed through and learned the song, because it helped me develop my limb independence.

Timing isn't great, but it's just good enough. I'm writing this well over a year after I recorded it. My timing has got better, as has my general level of drumming.
